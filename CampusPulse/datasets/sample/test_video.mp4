# This is a placeholder for a test video file
# In a real implementation, this would be an actual MP4 video file
# 
# Sample video specifications:
# - Duration: 5 seconds
# - Resolution: 720p (1280x720)
# - Frame rate: 30 FPS
# - Exercise: Squat demonstration
# - Subject: Athlete performing 3 squats with good form
# 
# The video would contain:
# 1. Setup phase (0-1 seconds): Athlete in standing position
# 2. Descent phase (1-2 seconds): Squatting down movement
# 3. Hold phase (2-2.5 seconds): Bottom position hold
# 4. Ascent phase (2.5-3.5 seconds): Standing back up
# 5. Repeat phases for additional reps
# 
# File size: Approximately 2-5 MB
# Format: MP4 with H.264 video codec
# 
# To use real video files in production:
# 1. Record exercise demonstrations with proper lighting
# 2. Ensure clear visibility of full body movement
# 3. Use stable camera positioning
# 4. Include multiple angles if possible
# 5. Annotate with ground truth technique labels
# 
# Note: Binary video files are not included in this text-based codebase
# In a real deployment, you would replace this placeholder with actual video files
