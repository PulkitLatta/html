- Format: MP4 (H.264 codec)
- Resolution: 1920x1080

- Athlete centered in frame
- Good lighting conditions
- Minimal background distractions
- Stable camera position

This placeholder file is used for testing and development purposes
where actual video files are not available in the repository.

To use actual video data:
1. Replace this file with test_video.mp4
2. Ensure video meets the specifications above
3. Verify pose detection works with the video content
4. Update file paths in related scripts and tests
